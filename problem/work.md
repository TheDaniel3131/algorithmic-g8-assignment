## Real-Life Problem: E-commerce Product Sorting
Problem Description:
E-commerce platforms handle massive amounts of data, including product listings that need to be sorted based on various criteria such as price, popularity, ratings, or relevance to a search query. Efficient sorting is crucial for providing a smooth and responsive user experience, allowing customers to quickly find the products they are interested in.

Real-Life Examples:
1. Sorting Products by Price
Scenario:
An e-commerce website needs to display a list of products sorted by price in ascending order when a user selects the "sort by price: low to high" option.

Relevance:
Customers often sort products by price to find the most affordable options. Efficient sorting ensures that the website can quickly respond to user actions, especially during high-traffic periods like sales events.

2. Sorting Products by Popularity
Scenario:
An online store wants to sort products by popularity, where popularity is determined by the number of purchases or views a product has received.

Relevance:
Displaying popular products at the top of the list can drive more sales and enhance user satisfaction. Sorting by popularity helps customers discover trending items, improving their shopping experience.
